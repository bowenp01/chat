# chat
A prototype chat application that looks a little like Whatsapp .. Working but unfinished.
Cobbled together as an exercise in teaching myself some basic Node.JS.

Clone or download the source code.
All of the Node packages will be missing so get them by typing this at the command line in the source code directory:

npm install

Run server.js by typing this at the command line in the source code directory:

node server.js

The chat server will be listening on port 3000. Fire up a web browser. In the navigation bar type:

127.0.0.1:3000

You should see the chat application. If you're on another machine on a network and you want to connect to the chat server navigate to:
http://<ip address that server is running on>:3000

Some of the code has come from the book 'Node.js In Action' by Mike Cantelon, Marc Harter, T.J. Holowaychuck and Nathan Rajlich.
I recommend the book, I found it really usefull not having used node before.
